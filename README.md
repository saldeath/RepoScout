# RepoScout  
**Intro**  
RepoScout is an app that pulls items from the server and saves them in the database. When the app is opened, the most recent 10 items will be fetched. When scrolling down past the oldest item another block of 10 items will be appended to the list.
  
 **Uses Clean Architecture:**    
 Data - Contains all the data logic    
 Domain - Contains all the business logic    
 Presentation - Contains all the presentation & view logic
